              <h2>Yasmina story</h2>
              <p>Yasmina was a strong and independent person, but when she was diagnosed with cancer, she faced her biggest challenge yet. Despite feeling overwhelmed, Yasmina refused to let cancer control her life. She researched treatment options, talked to doctors, and leaned on her support system. Even when chemotherapy left her feeling weak and tired, Yasmina refused to give up. One day, she noticed a scared woman sitting across from her at the infusion center and went over to introduce herself. They struck up a conversation and Yasmina offered words of encouragement and hope. From then on, Yasmina made it her mission to help others fighting cancer. She started volunteering, organized a support group, and became a beacon of hope for others. Even after beating cancer and living a full life, Yasmina knew her legacy would continue to inspire others.</p>
